      <title>Knowledge Transfer in OpenSource</title>
      <description>
Projects like Pypy and CPython are complex undertakings. Even to start contributing, 
people are intimidated. As maintainers of such projects, the amount of knowledge 
accumulated over the years is just huge. This episode explores the history and evoltion of Pypy.
It debunks the myth of it's difficult to contribute to Pypy. It covers efforts undertaken to
help people get initiated and progress. We also get to listen to Bahutan's own experience of 
being onboarded to the Pypy project. It also contrasts the Pypy experience with the CPython one.
A dream podcast for me!
